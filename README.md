# SRH-SAI-Protocol-Gate-Public
Symbiotic Autonomous Intelligence (SAI) is SRH’s protocol-driven approach to making AI systems more honest, coherent, and auditable without rip-and-replace. 
This repo hosts public-facing materials that explain the problem (“sycophancy” and the AI trust bubble), our solution (policy/uncertainty overlays with minimal interventions), and how enterprises can evaluate SAI with client-owned metrics.
Contents represent a curated set of public artifacts describing SRH’s SAI protocols, positioning, and evaluation approach.
Designed for awareness, technical leadership alignment, and procurement-readiness. 
Safe for public sharing. 
Proprietary internals, prompts/templates, datasets, and low-level implementation details are not included.
